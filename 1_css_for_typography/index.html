		<h1>CSS for typography</h1>

		<p>
			In the 90s, web pages were pretty text-centric. CSS was designed to style that text, and to position objects on the page. These exercises focus on working with text: positioning exercises are <a href="https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/styling/2_the_box_model.md">here</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>
		  CSS was released in 1996, and it "aimed to describe the presentation of structured documents" – fonts, colours, and positioning – using "common desktop publishing terminology", which looked like this:
		</p>

		<pre>
			<code>body { font-size: 1em; }</code>
		</pre>

		<p>
		  Why was CSS designed type-first? At the time, desktop publishing was all about digital typesetting. HTML derives from structure-defining languages used for earlier digital typesetting in the 70s. CSS – designed to style HTML&nbsp;– therefore focussed first on type, fonts, colours: the written word.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Even though CSS now works with loads of different things – animations, responsive interfaces, image filters – its roots are in typography. When surprised by a peculiar design choice in CSS, the root is often "it works like it works because CSS is principally designed to work with text".
		</p>

		<p>
		  Text is still a dominant internet medium, and poor typography is a barrier to readability. Getting good at working with it is a good introduction to using CSS.
